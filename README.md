# prediction_of_backorders-_in_supplychain
Backorders is a common supply chain problem, wherein a customer places an order for a product that is temporarily out of stock.
The percentage of items backordered and the number of backorder days are important measures of the quality of a customer's service and the effiectiveness of inventory management.

A company can manage its inventory more efficiently using a prediction on the backorder risk for the products. Goal here is to use the past data and metadata around the backorders, 
and provide a prediction on the potential products for backorders.
